# Description

We ask candidates to undertake a small development exercise for us so they can demonstrate their technical prowess. In this instance, we want you to build a simple Rails application which comprises an events calendar. This application will consist of an /events page which displays a weekly calendar highlighting the current date. Application users must be able to create an event which contains start and end date plus a description.
Furthermore, the created event should instantly show on the calendar along with some indication as to when the event starts and finishes. The image on the /events page provides an example of what we are looking for.
Given this requirement, candidates should create an EventsController with these actions: index, create.
Events should be saved in a backend store without refreshing the page.
This is an example of what we would like it to look like, however it doesnâ€™t need to be pixel perfect.

Candidates may use any gems/plugins when building your solution. However, we will question candidates on their choices of gems/plugins.
Please commit changes to git often with descriptive messages. These messages and the granularity of commits will be examined.
Most candidates take around 3-7 hours.  Please try to keep your work to under 6 hours if you can
